Why I got my amateur radio license and why you should too!
==========================================================
<!--more-->

It would be easy for me to list the practical reasons why one would want to become a ham, it would be a lie to say that is why I did it. No, it wasn't to prep for the world's inevitable end, or my adventures to off-grid locations, or to make contact with potential extraterrestrial beings. In truth, I viewed this FCC-issued license, in which the vast majority of holders are white middle-aged men, as a challenge to be bested. 

While there are examples of the good-natured, friendly-contact side of the hobby, generally there are very few aspects of it that cater to a new and more diverse generation of ham radio operators. This is why instead of offering more criticism I will now attempt to persuade the reader to pursue a license of their own! 

Why you need to get yours
=============================

### If you’re nosy you are listening to other people's conversation
This is truly the crux of the hobby, just tune your radio, lean back, and enjoy the banter of two men having a heated political debate or comparing antenna lengths. 

### You can put it on your resume
Flex your STEM knowledge by listing this unique government-issued license! 

### It’s pretty easy to get 
All you have to do is take a 35 multiple choice question test, and two more optional tests if you want a more advanced license. The test is a review of your high school Physics class, and there's so much free prep material online. 

### You get a cool little call sign
A unique string of letters and numbers could be yours today!

### If you’re a custom-built PC person.
Level up and be a custom-built radio person! 

Jokes aside, amateur radio is not only a practical skill to have, but it is also a pretty fun hobby. If you have any interest in tech hobbies get your license and help to diversify the airwaves!
