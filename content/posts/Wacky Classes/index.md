Classes I saw in the course catalog and said: "sounds fun." 
<!--more-->
Most American universities make students complete a finite amount of credit hours before graduation. After completing the required classes for my major and minor, I still needed to take a few classes just to have enough course hours to graduate. So, there were times when I had the freedom to pick classes like I was looking at the menu at a Michelin-star restaurant, and the name of the entre and Yelp was all I had to go on. Except in this case the menu was the course catalog and Rate my Professor was standing in for Yelp.

##WRIT20303: Writing Games 
This was a class taught by a very young Ph.D. candidate whose dissertation has something to do with tabletop role-playing games. Thus, we were taught how to write adventures for Dungeons and Dragons. I think if the stars aligned this class would be a contender for the top five, but it was on zoom and everyone was too shy and awkward to make any play through fun. The textbook for this class was the Player's Handbook and the required reading included Lovecraft.
*3/5 hit points*

##HLTH30213: Human Sexuality
This class should be required for all college students. I learned more relevant information in this lecture than in any other “core credit” I have ever had to take. For the most part, without getting too explicit, it’s exactly what it sounds like. The students and this class received the most detailed, informative, and unbiased sex education class. Not to mention the anecdotes that came out of the class discussions were amazing. 
*5/5 I have a journal full of notes from this class somewhere*

##ENGL30833: Serials Franchises Fan Culture Course Topic: Sherlock Holmes
The structure of the class was as follows: the pre-class reading was one Sherlock Holmes adventure and one academic article that connected the fictional reading with the nature of fan culture. Then, we would meet as a class once a week for three hours to watch the visual adaption of the mystery we read and have a class discussion about fan culture. It was bliss. The class felt more like a book club, and since fan culture is so prevalent I had never been so interested in a class discussion. At the end of our semester, we could write an ethnography about a fandom that we were passionate about. Thus was born a ten-page paper about Dark Souls that got me an A in the class. 
*5/5 It’s elementary my dear Watson.*

##GEOL30123: Dinosaurs and Their World
This class had like five people in it and I could not be more grateful for the random dinosaur knowledge I have acquired. The issue was that we did not see our grade until the very end of the class and the tests were all short answer questions. It was certainly vigorous for the subject matter but overall, I enjoyed this class very much. 
*4/5 coprolites*
